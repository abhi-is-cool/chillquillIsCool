# Chillquill Intro
This is **chillquill**, the chill note taking app for you. Make thorough, organized notes in a quirky interface with help from AI in enhancing your notes, creating quizzes, and answering any questions you may have.

*Note: This repository only contains the frontend. The backend was not included for security reasons. Thank you for your understanding!* 

### Featured Features
Our favorite feature is the mascot switch in the settings menu, where you can change from casual and friendly **Chillian** to grumpy but still helpful **Old Grumps** (Frankly, his responses are much more fun to read).

Another fun feature is the theme changing, which can help you personalize your experience on the app. We hope to add folder color changes soon, after we work out some bugs.

The most useful feature is probably the google drive sync, which we are still in the process of implementing. Updates will be sent out soon!

### How to Use
**Chillquill** was designed to be pretty intuitive, but if you still need some help, you're in the right place.

**Creating and Deleting Notes**: You can create notes by clicking the "Quill Something" button and delete them by hovering over them and clicking delete. To delete them permanently, go to trash and permanently delete them.

**Changing Settings**: You can edit your settings by clicking the "Settings" button. _**Be sure to scroll down and click "Save Settings"!**_ Settings can be reset to defaults by clicking the "Reset to Defaults" button.
